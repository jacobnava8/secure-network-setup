# 🔒 Secure Network Setup

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the process of configuring **secure operating systems and network environments**.  
The focus is on **system hardening**, **firewall rules**, and **baseline security configurations** to reduce the attack surface and enforce best practices.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Review configuration files in `configs/` for firewall and OS hardening steps.  
2. Apply firewall rules on Linux (`iptables`, `ufw`) or Windows Firewall.  
3. Follow baseline security setup instructions (password policies, service restrictions, logging).  
4. Use diagrams in `docs/` to replicate the secure network design.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Operating Systems: Windows Server, Linux (Ubuntu/Kali)  
- Firewalls: iptables, ufw, Windows Firewall  
- Security Baselines: CIS Benchmarks, OS Hardening Guides

## 📊 Results
- Implemented **firewall rules** to restrict untrusted traffic  
- Hardened operating systems with strong password policies & minimized services  
- Reduced overall attack surface by applying baseline security configurations
